 My research imperatives run along the threads of trans-mediation, inter-semiotic translation, post-disciplinarity (interdisciplinarity, multidiscplinarity) and the general concerns of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
 A large part of my contemporary practices in creating audiovisual materials is through creative coding. In coding there is the possibility to use plenty of expressions or functionalities. Coding and creative writing have many similarities in the way the writer-scripter organises the text with ideas; the mind can become creative; as it is, coding helps to increase imagination.</description>

 &amp;#34;The L-Systems, also known as Lindenmayer Systems, are a class of algorithms for the production of structures based on recursive rewriting rules. “The L-systems are widely used in the composition of graphics mainly for the production of complex forms of plants as well as the imitation of other natural forms ”(Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer 1990; Rozenberg and Grzegorz 1992).</description>

      <description>chapter 1   Algorithmic Composition   Algorithm is:
  A set of mathematical instructions that must be followed in a fixed order, and that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a mathematical
  problem [1].
  A systematic procedure that produces – in a finite number of steps the answer to a question or the solution of a problem [2].</description>
