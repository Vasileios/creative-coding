* Creative coding

** Introduction

My research imperatives run along the threads of transmediation,
intersemiotic translation, post-disciplinarity and the general concerns of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Key words:* big-data, data, creative-coding, emacs, interaction, machine learning, org-mode, real-time, streaming, web 
#+END_QUOTE

* Mental objectives

The basic elements of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects,
classes).

concepts of *object-oriented programming, interactivity, interactive design, connectivity and interconnection*

** Interactive installations

Use of circuits and how to hack them. A great opportunity to learn,
design, recycle old toys and instruments, and transformed them to an alternate instrument.

** Machine learning

- method of data analysis

- data sonification, visualisation

- Programming language

Python




* Methodology and tools

Investigation on different environments and to create interconnection.

creative programming environments:

- Emacs as a basic editor and Git file sharing
(https://github.com/magit/magit), 

- SuperCollider, and
- Python 
- C++ and openFrameworks

for data analysis sonification, visualisation.

** Input devices 

- midi controllers, 
- OSC communication,
- microcontrollers (arduino),
and physical computing,
- sensor usage, 
- multitouch technologies, etc. 

** Organising and sharing

organising and sharing projects using tools such as mass communication techniques Slack-Git.



* SuperCollider

From: [[http://supercollider.github.io][SuperCollider]]

** Basics

SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound. It is free and open source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

** SuperCollider features three major components:

- *scsynth*, a real-time audio server, forms the core of the platform. It features 400+ unit generators ("UGens") for analysis, synthesis, and processing. Its granularity allows the fluid combination of many known and unknown audio techniques, moving between additive and subtractive synthesis, FM, granular synthesis, FFT, and physical modelling. You can write your own UGens in C++, and users have already contributed several hundred more to the sc3-plugins repository.
- *sclang*, an interpreted programming language. It is focused on sound, but not limited to any specific domain. sclang controls scsynth via Open Sound Control. You can use it for algorithmic composition and sequencing, finding new sound synthesis methods, connecting your app to external hardware including MIDI controllers, network music, writing GUIs and visual displays, or for your daily programming experiments. It has a stock of user-contributed extensions called Quarks.
- *scide* is an editor for sclang with an integrated help system.


  
** Nodes

From: [[https://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/sctutorial/6.3%2520Nodes.html][composerprogrammer.com]]

The Server has a graph of all the running Synths, which may be organised into Groups for convenience. You can see Synths and Groups being created just by looking at the Server graphics.

A Node means a Synth or a Group. Whenever you press command+period you reset the graph, cleaning out all the Synths and Groups you added, that is, clearing all Nodes.

The initial state of the Node graph on the Server looks like this (do command+period first to destroy any existing nodes so you have the starting state):

#+BEGIN_SRC js
s.queryAllNodes //run me to see the Nodes on the Server
#+END_SRC

The two default Nodes are convenient Groups for putting your Synths into.

Group(0) is the absolute root of the tree. All new Synths get placed within this Group somewhere (they might be in subGroups but they will be within the RootNode Group at the top of the hierarchy).

#+BEGIN_SRC js
r=RootNode.new; //this gets a reference to Group(0)
#+END_SRC

Group(1) was added as an additional default to receive all created Synths, to avoid cluttering the base of the tree.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
Group.basicNew(s, 1); //this gets a reference to Group(1)
#+END_SRC

** Mapping the Data from the Input Device

The message coming from digital input devices are streams of binary
numbers. A microprocessor inside the receiving symthesizer must decode
these streams before commanding the synthesis engine  to emit
sound. (Roads 1996: 625)


** Remote Controllers

* Emacs

GNU Emacs
An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more.
At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.
...[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]

** Install packages

Install org-plus-contrib

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; add this to your Emacs init file to be able to list the Org mode archives:

(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)

Then M-x list-packages RET will list both the latest org and
org-plus-contrib packages.

#+END_SRC
** Org-mode

** Create Headers

Start with an *asterisk* to make *Headers* and *two asterisks* for *Subheaders*

Example:

=/* Header/=

=/** Subheader/=

Give a *title* to your page using /hash/ (#) and /plus/ (+) symbols

Example: =/#+Title: Getting started with org-mode/=

#+Title: Getting started with org-mode

*Hide* Table of Contents

Example: =/#+Options: toc:nil/=

#+Options: toc:nil

*Hide* Numbers, table of contents

Example: =/#+Options: num:nil/ toc:nil=

Write =#+= and press =Meta-<tab>= to see the list of variables

Example:

 =#+AUTHOR: Vasilis Agiomyrgianakis=

=#+DATE: 120416=

** Bulleting-Quoting

Use hyphen to make bullets

- bulleted
- list
- items

You can include quotations in Org mode documents like this:

=#+BEGIN_QUOTE=

'QUATATION'

=#+END_QUOTE=

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

A frequent criticism of computer music is the lack of performance, \\
where an artist hides behind their laptop screen, \\
and the audience is unable to see any activity that might ground their experience \\
of the music (Cascone, 2003).


#+END_QUOTE

** Markups

Give *emphasis* to your text.

Write your text *inside* the below symbols:

- 2 asterics for *Bold*,
- 2 slashes for /italics/,
- 2 equals signs for =verbatim=,
- 2 pluses for +strike through text+

*Bold*, /italics/, =verbatim=, +strikethrough+

** Linking 

 Press =C-c C-l= to *link* objects (files)

Example:

/Link: https//:basmyr.net/

Then give a name to the linked text

/Description: Basmyr.net/

 Press =C-c C-o= to *open* the linked plain text with an external program

[[http://basmyr.net][Basmyr.net]]

or a video url

[[https://youtu.be/Wr2aFlWyzvM][Granulator]]

** Tables

Use *pipes - vertical bars* to make tables

Example: Start with pipes and some text:
/| some | | Data |/

then hit return, pipe (vertical bar), hyphen and tab to extend the table verticaly

Press tab and arrows to make arrangements for the table

| Some | Data  |
|------+-------|
|  234 | rocks |
| 1200 | start |

** Images & Graphics
** Images

** Ditaa

*Find the path of ditaa.jar in you computer through a lisp program*

=C-c C-c= to evaluate lisp code inside source block

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(expand-file-name
             "ditaa.jar"
      (file-name-as-directory
            (expand-file-name
                "scripts"
               (file-name-as-directory
                  (expand-file-name
                      "../contrib"
                     (file-name-directory (org-find-library-dir "org")))))))
#+END_SRC


** Export to other formats

Pressing =C-c C-e= popups a buffer to *export* markups to HTML-PDF-etc.

Example: hit =h= and =o= if you want to *export and open as html*.

Export Beamer: =C-c C-e l P=     =(org-beamer-export-to-pdf)=

Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF.

=C-c C-e l O=

Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF, then open the resulting PDF file.

** Source Code

Create code blocks to insert your code.

Press C-c ' *inside the SRC block* to edit the current code block

in the mode of the language you want. For instance:

 =#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp=

write some lisp to make your configurations in org-mode

so as to see bullets (UTF-8 characters) when you editing *Headers* in org-mode instead of asterisks.

Then close the source block with:

=#+END_SRC=

*Result*

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

     (require 'org-bullets)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))


#+END_SRC

*You can customise source blocks using =M-x customize-face RET= face RET*

Evaluate source code. Press C-c C-c inside the block and see the results.

 #+BEGIN_Example
 echo "Hello $USER! Today is `date`"
 exit
 #+END_Example

*Install aspell from brew*

#+BEGIN_Example

$ brew install aspell --with-lang-en --with-lang-el --with-lang-de

#+END_Example

for English, Hellenic and Deutsch languages.

if you have problems installing aspell with the above code

just do only:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

$ brew install aspell

#+END_SRC

*Install aspell using downloaded packages aspell-0.60.6.1*

go to terminal and type:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ cd ~/aspell path
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
#+END_SRC

To install additional dictionary download the language you prefer from  [[ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html][GNU_Available Aspell Dictionaries]]

i.e =aspell-el-0.50-3= for Hellenic language (Greek)

and go to terminal and type:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ cd ~/dictionary path
$ ./configure
$ make
$ install
#+END_SRC

*Switch dictionary*

To switch between dictionaries run:

M-x: =ispell-change-dictionary=

and write /greek/ for Hellenic language auto-correct

Press F6 (fn-F6) to switch between dictionaries (british, greek, german)

If you want to use the english dictionary in a particular buffer instead,
put the following on the first line of the buffer:

=-*- ispell-dictionary: "english" -*-=

*Use flyspell instead of ispell*

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq ispell-list-command "--list")
#+END_SRC
 
** text expansion

install YASnippet using MELPA

put the below into your init.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path
             "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
(require 'yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

quit emacs and open again and type

=M-x yas-new-snippet=

- Give a name to your snippet
- give the abrev
- write your text or code you want to be expanted
- save file C-c C-c
- choose a table i.e prog-mode
- give a name to your snippet (I use the abrev key as the name)

try using the abrev key and press tab to expant your text.


** Searching Help


C-h f (or M-x describe-function) will show you the bindings for a command.
You are correct, C-h b (or M-x describe-bindings) will show you all bindings. C-h m (M-x describe-mode) is also handy to list bindings by mode.
You might also try C-h k (M-x describe-key) to show what command is bound to a key. For instance, on my machine save-buffers-kill-emacs isn't bound to anything, but C-h k C-x C-c tells me that C-x C-c is bound to save-buffers-kill-terminal. It will list all bindings for the command at the same time.
